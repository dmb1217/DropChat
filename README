#What is this?
DropChat is an app made with angularjs that allows users to drop messages on a map for others to read. Messages are asynchronously added to the map when someone makes a post, so all messages are visible immediately. Socket.io is being made use of to link a user to the most recently dropped message, but currently only one message is shown at a time. This is a very basic, but functional, version of something that could potentially become much larger.

#The Future
1. Public user profiles
2. Custom marker icons (food, music, bars, coffee, etc.)
3. Upvote/downvote with specific downvote threshold resulting in deletion
4. Administrator security group
5. Easier post management
6. Running asynchronous posts in a side bar
7. Filtering by marker type, points, or user
8. Cleaning up the code and putting more things into functions
