The stock Yeoman generated node_modules are required. 
Install grunt into the local directory. 
Then use bower install --allow-root to complete setup.

----------------
I spent so much time getting the map functionality started that 
I didn't have time to set up socket.io with anything. 

Currently, a user can create, edit, and view a custom profile page.
Once logged in, the user can 'drop' messages on the map which
any other user can see anywhere in the world. They can currently 
edit or delete their posts using the menu service, which will remove them from the map. 

Gmaps already only allows 25 markers to be displayed on the map at a time, so
zooming into an area will natively begin to draw the markers for us
depending on the region shown with the zoom level.

What's not implemented?
A lot :(
I wanted the users to be able to click on a name in a map's
infowindow to link them to that user's profile, but I ran
out of time to do that. I also need to set up socket.io (which
is already installed into public/lib) with something, but
I'm not really sure what I should use it for yet. Any ideas
for something simple but useful would be appreciated. 

Currently, if a user drops and submits a message, nothing happens.
The user must manually refresh the page in order for the message
to appear for them. I plan on implementing a map redraw on submit,
which should do the trick, but I could never get it to work. I was
using google.maps.event.trigger(map, 'resize'); 

Also couldn't get the page to redirect to /#!/ with 
$location so i'm just using jscript location.refresh().
